To Šalim-Aššur from Adad-rabi: as to the tablets concerning Iddin-abum that you wrote to me about - I asked Aššur-malik and Šalim-Aššur, saying: When Issu-arik cleared up Iddin-abum's affairs with Merani, with the Ištar-priest and Zaktaya's firm, and where he gave him a free loan, at that time he paid what silver he could - and did they certify his tablets for the rest of the silver, stating that Iddin-abum owed it, and that Šalim-Aššur was the guarantor?" They answered: "No tablet at all was certified. He sent us the silver and we paid the men." They continued: "It is true that Issu-arik discussed with him in our presence and said: 'Pay the debt of your brother, both here and abroad, and then go and take it again out of your brother's silver. If there is no silver belonging to your brother, then pay out of your joint-stock capital.'"

I seized Aššur-malik and Šalim-Aššur and said: "You have heard the missive of Šalim-Aššur concerning grain. Speak up and send word to the man about how much grain has been stored." They answered: "Now  pressure us for the grain, but our own free loans, where are they?" He may come and someone will take away the grain. They continued: "The last five years we have been unwilling to follow his orders." I said: "Why are you angry?" They answered: "Apart from the free loans that we gave to him we have no other quarrel with him." My dear father, my dear lord - do not treat me harshly because word from me has not reached you until today! I said to myself: "Why should I send insulting words to him?" huraṣānum offered me 10 shekels of silver to dispose of there, but I said: "I have received a similar amount from Šalim-Aššur." So send me the money!"

I take responsibility. I shall have the man extradited. Since he did not acquire my brother's blood-money, and since he bothered (me) with the silver of my father's house for two years and my brother surely was killed because of his iron, (therefore) assist my sister and my brother's daughter there, appeal to the City assembly and acquire a capable attorney.

I questioned your representatives, saying: "How did you sell the tin?" They answered: "It was sold at the rate 8 (shekels) minus 22.5 grains. Seize the silver and 11.3333 minas 2 shekels was the rest of your tin." Before I arrived you had not (been) paid the silver; the day I arrived I had the silver paid and the silver is under our seals. Since there is no affiliated trader among the travellers who can be responsible for some 10 minas of silver, for that reason we held the silver back. Do not get angry. The silver is ready. Within 5 days Šu-Hubur has promised to leave. We shall send you your silver with Šu-Hubur. I made Šukkutum pay 4 minas of silver from what was in his certified tablet. Total of your silver, both from the proceeds from the tin ... from Šukkutum; in all Šu-Hubur will bring you 15 minas 11 shekels of silver under our seals, also the proceeds from 8 minas of tin, from the šilipki'u that Ilī-ašrannī brought; 7 shekels were given to Šukkutum — both the tin and that from the šilipki'u and from his tablet, and from the proceeds of your pirikannus — we shall clear with the next transport and send Hanu.

From Aššur-malik, Šalim-Aššur and Iliya to Šalim-Aššur: Before Aššur-šadu'e arrived, before he brought your letter, Šu-Bēlum arrived two months before Aššur-šadu'e, and Šu-Bēlum seized Šu-Kūbum son of Aššur-bēl-awātim and his brother and conducted them to the City assembly, and then it was us who rebuffed the matter, saying: Their case is closed. He is reopening a matter that has been sworn by the City." The City passed a verdict, stating that Šu-Bēlum and Issu-arik's daughter must not raise claim against Šu-Kūbum and his brother. Šu-Kūbum must go to Kanesh to make you and Itūr-ilī confirm to Šu-Bēlum that he entrusted the goods to you. Since he has raised claim against you for everything that had been sworn by the City, you must come and open a case for your paternal estate within one year. Dated the beginning of the month Bēlat-ekallim, the eponymy of Elāli son of Ikūnum. Urgent! As to your tablets, your witnesses, your judges, those who settled your affair - he who will come to the City should come; he who will not come you must extradite - confirm your tablets and your witnesses! Come and give a lawsuit for your paternal estate, for if you do not come, they will take 4 talents of tin and 100 on your account. The tablets belonging to him with his witnesses have been put before the City assembly and they have entered the City Hall. They are in the City Hall. Šu-Bēlum holds a certified tablet with the king's seal, stating that you must give him a lawsuit within one year. Since the matter was concluded two months ago, when we heard the letters that Aššur-šadu'e brought, we made inquiries but we did not go back to the City assembly. Kuziziya brought 10 minas of silver; hinnaya brought 10 minas of silver, and 20 minas of silver have been deducted from your debt. Later on Šu-Bēlum came and he said to hinnaya: "I entrusted 20 minas of silver to you." Without those who know about it hinnaya informed him and said: "Yes, you entrusted (that) to me. I shall make inquiries, and if they did not bring it, I shall buy it at a merchant's house and pay you." Šu-Bēlum said: "The 10 minas that Kuziziya brought is available." hinnaya gave in in the matter and borrowed 10 minas of silver from a merchant's house and paid him. Also, hinnaya received a certified tablets stating that it will be deducted from your debt. In all, 30 minas of silver will be deducted from your debt. Send the silver to hinnaya so the interest will not make you suffer. In the matter concerning Aššur-bāni ... confronted the City assembly and ... Had you been present, would they (not) have treated his words as chaff? For the statement where you said: "May the City judge my case", you are to pay 1 mina 10 shekels of silver. Since he formally mentioned a bribe but did not prove it, had you been present, would he (not) be dead? We borrowed the silver against interest and paid it. Send silver. Urgent! Do not act superior in this matter! Come and clear it up. What can your investors do for you? You have no answer to them, except saying: "I have been extradited!" You do not consider your losses, you do not seek the face of your god! Urgent! As soon as you have heard the letter, strengthen your tablets and your witnesses, set out and come! ... An attorney ..."

Since my servants have acted high-handedly until this day and have not travelled to Damiq-pī-Aššur, and have not converted my goods to silver - for that reason I became worried, and since my textiles are infested with moths, I thought: "Let me enter with my goods and collect my assets, so that I may receive some 10 minas of silver that may be collected from my customers. Let me enter Kanesh with my assets." My dear brothers, until I clear myself, you there - together with the representatives of the affiliated traders who are staying there - should pester the men for the case, learn what they have to say and let them set the terms that are possible for them, and make me approach the colony. They know the losses and the maintenance, but without permission from my investors Ilī-ālum, Šu-Kūbum, Aššur-malik and Amur-Ištar's son I cannot leave to go overland. They say: "Leave, we shall settle your matter ourselves with Lā-qēpum, and then send you word, so you yourself can collect your assets and then we shall set the terms for you as best we can." My dear brothers, the men are favourable towards us. Pester them there for the case that I may clear myself, and then send word to me personally and give me encouragement. Keep an eye there on my servants just as you have done thus far, and let them assemble every last shekel of silver from my outstanding loans.

From Aššur-malik and Šalim-Aššur to Šalim-Aššur: Before Aššur-šadue came and before he brought your letter, Šu-Bēlum came - two months before Aššur-šadue - and Šu-Bēlum seized Šu-Kūbum son of Aššur-bēl-awātim and his brother, and led them to the City assembly, and then it was us who rebuffed the matter and said: Their case is closed. He is reopening a matter which has been sworn by the City." The City assembly passed a verdict that Šu-Bēlum and Issu-arik's daughter must not raise claim against Šu-Kūbum and his brother. Šu-Kūbum will go to Kanesh to confirm Itūr-ilī and you to Šu-Bēlum, (namely) that he entrusted the merchandise to you (plur.). Since he raised claim against you for everything that had been sworn by the City, you are to come and within 1 year you are to open the case for your paternal house. Beginning of the month Bēlat-ekallim, eponymy Elāli son of Ikūnum. Urgent, as to your tablets, your witnesses, your judges and those who settled your case - let he who will go to the City come here, extradite the one who will not go - confirm your tablets and your witnesses, come and open the case for your paternal house! If you have not come, they will take 4 talents of tin and 100 on your account. The tablets blelonging to him with his witnesses have been placed before the City assembly and they have entered the City Hall and are in the City Hall. He holds a certified tablet sealed by the king, stating that you are to come within 1 year and that you must answer his case. Since the matter was concluded 2 months ago, we heard the tablets that Aššur-šadue son of Tu'imum brought, and we made enquiries but we will not go back to the City assembly. Kuziziya brought 10 minas of silver; hinnaya brought 10 minas of silver and 20 minas of silver has been deducted from your debt. Then later Šu-Bēlum came and Šu-Bēlum said to hinnaya: "I entrusted 20 minas of sealed silver to you." hinnaya without those who know did not confer with us, but said: "Yes, you did entrust it to me. I shall ask, and if they did not bring it I shall buy it in a merchant-house and pay you." Šu-Bēlum said: "The 10 minas of silver that Kuziziya brought, are available." hinnaya gave in in the matter and borrowed 10 minas of silver from a merchant-house and paid, and hinnaya got a certified tablet stating that it will be deducted from your debt. In all, 30 minas of silver will be deducted from your debt. Send the silver to hinnaya so the interest will not hurt you. In the matter concerning Aššur-bāni ... he turned to the City assembly and said: "A bribe!" Had you been present would they (not) have treated his word like chaff? For the statement you made, namely: "Let the City judge my case!" - you are to pay 1 mina 10 shekels of silver. As he claimed that it was a bribe, but did not prove it against you, if you had come, would he (not) be dead? We borrowed 1 mina 10 shekels of silver against interest and paid. Send silver. Urgent, do not act superior in this matter! Come and clear your paternal house. What can your investors do for you? You have no answer for them except saying: "I have been extradited." You do not consider your losses. You do not seek your god's face. Urgent, when you have heard the letter, secure your tablets and your witnesses, set out and come! In the sacred precinct you have been accused five times already! Are you not ashamed? How long are you going to wait?"

Let my brother Šalim-Aššur come, and then settle with him. Then my own representatives, Šu-Illil and Amur-Ištar may assist my brother. Until my brother arrives no one may open my tablets."

If with the silver or copper that I sent up to you you have not yet made purchases, then remove the silver and let it stay where you are.
